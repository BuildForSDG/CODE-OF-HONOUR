            <p class="lead">The CODE OF HONOUR</b> is moral codes, ethics, values and rules to help restore, reform, re-plan, re-make, remold,
                re- establish, and re-structure Africa on the right path of Peace, Justice and strong institution. This can
                be done by taking allegiance to the code of honor, whereby taking action and instilling the codes in every
                institutions. This code of honor is derived from 12 fundamental core values that re-establish the Africa
                to a glorious future.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                        Code of Honour is a vision to help put an end to depravity, poverty, corruption and death in Africa. This came as a result
                        of moral decadence in Africa. Code of Honour is to instil core moral values into every aspect of
                        life and institutions, whereby every citizen of African will live in harmony, peace, love, justice,
                        equality and prosperity. We know the situation present in most African countries, as such there is
                        a need not just only empowering the people with resources that meet their needs; but also instilling
                        core moral values that change their thought, as a result, change Africa. Africa has been known for
                        moral decadence, poverty, corruption and evil. However, this can only be changed when African people
                        change their thought and reconsider their ways and turn around to do the right thing. This will bring
                        transformation, reformation and eventually produce equality, peace and prosperity. Code of Honour
                        is created to raise men of honour in all aspect of life. Whereby we go out and impart the codes through
                        education reformation, community reformation and leadership reformation. Nations that have peace,
                        unity, equality and justice have core moral values in place, right from their foundation. As such
                        no nation can advance if these core values are misplaced. Hence, Africa must be transformed, reformed
                        and save from corruption, poverty and death. Our impact will be felt in all aspects of life in African
                        nations, majorly reforming education, not just educating only but also instilling core values that
                        shape a nation. We will work with Educationist, to restructure their teaching approach and teaching
                        resources to instal the code of hour, as they impart to the student. If this core moral value is
                        taught not just as mere words, but practically illustrated and imparted into the student day to day
                        activities. 
                        <p>There will be a new generation of students who have changed their thought, as a result,
                        change their world. Enough of leaders being corrupt, whereby they cause havoc and influence young
                        leaders with a bad attitude. We know this attitude will be transferred to the younger generation
                        of leaders in that manner of their past leaders. This bad transition must stop, a new approach, a
                        new thought, a new reformation, a new understanding, a new reformation will spring forth in every
                        Education institution and in another aspect of life in African nations. No nation can progress if
                        the thought of the people living is self-centeredness, no sacrifice to help others, or see the good
                        of others or rather sacrificially serving the people. That nation will end up in jeopardy. Most times,
                        we have heard of leaders of African nation being corrupt, this has not just resurrected shortly,
                        this has been seen from history that African leaders have been corrupt. Looking at days during the
                        slave trade, African leaders were self-centred, deciding to sell their brothers and sisters for the
                        exchange of material things which we know cause some to die and some to be separated from their parent
                        for life. 
                        <p>As such slave mentality among our leaders still strife in African nations, which we know
                        has caused poverty, death and hatred among the people. Code of honour will help to address these
                        past failures and evil. It will also break the inheritance of evil from generation to generation,
                        as such destroying and hindering peace and prosperity. There a lot to say on the strong impact that
                        will be felt by instilling the code of honour in all aspect of life in Africa nations. Let together
                        join hands and put a stop to poverty, corruption and death in African whereby
